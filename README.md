# musclebalancer

This is a work in progress and meant for practising the fundamentals of React/Node.js. 
It is a fitness app, which allows one to create training programs and receive feedback on which muscles are being trained and which ones are neglected.  This helps to create tailored programs for individual needs.  

Continuously deployed to Heroku through Heroku GitHub integration whenever the GitHub main branch is updated. Heroku takes care of the Docker image build.
App available here: https://musclebalancer.herokuapp.com
